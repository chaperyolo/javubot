# javuBot

javuBot is an Open Source project mean to be an easy integration between AWS Step Functions and Slack. Specially meant for Data Engineers who need to comunicate the progress, failures and successes of the ETLs they make.

Primarly based on what was done [here](https://www.fortisoft.io/send-your-aws-step-functions-execution-result-to-slack/),thank you guys at fortisoft!

The instructions for implementing it are going to be written here once the project is done.
